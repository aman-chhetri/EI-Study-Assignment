# Exercise 1: Problem Statement on Design Patterns


## Overview
This project demonstrates six different design patterns in Java. The patterns implemented include:
- **Behavioral Design Patterns:** Observer, Strategy
- **Creational Design Patterns:** Singleton, Factory
- **Structural Design Patterns:** Adapter, Decorator

Each pattern is implemented in its own package, containing related classes and a `Main` class that showcases how the pattern works.
